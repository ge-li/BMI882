##### Title: Genetic Signatures of Exceptional Longevity in Humans

##### Author(s): Sebastiani et al.

I'm not going to summarize these two papers of different versions since their abstracts described what they have done. The original paper has two problems: 

1. They "used a number of different genotyping platforms and neglected to perform data quality control steps. ...In particular, one of the platforms used in their work, the Illumina 610-Quad array, has been shown in unpublished studies by other investigators to produce artifactual genotype data at a subset of SNPs." They tried to fix this in the newer paper (thus the size reduction of discovery set). 
2. The "Replication Set." In the original paper, they used 254 cases vs. 341 controls as their independent test set, achieving; in the newer paper, they added another independent test set of 60 cases vs. 2863 controls. This is a problem because the prevalence rate of exceptional longevity (EL) is certainly not 254/341; even the second 60/2863 test set won't fix the problem. We studied and discussed the same issue of testing in the skin cancer paper and BMI 881 HW 2. The end results-58% specificity and 60% sensitivity in the test set 1, 61% specificity and  78% sensitivity in the test set 2-are hardly meaningful, let alone obtained by these two highly skewed data sets.

My questions:

1. Why are people still accepting skewed test set that doesn't reflect real unseen data??? (The skin cancer paper was also published in 2019.)
2. The manhattan plot in Fig. 3 of the newer paper looks strange because of the lack of the patterns of linkage disequilibrium in those identified loci.

**2010 Abstract** 

*Healthy aging is thought to reflect the combined influence of environmental factors (lifestyle choices) and genetic factors. To explore the genetic contribution, we undertook a genome-wide association study of exceptional longevity (EL) in 1055 centenarians and 1267 controls. Using these data, we built a genetic model that includes 150 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and found that it could predict EL with 77% accuracy in an independent set of centenarians and controls. Further in silico analysis revealed that 90% of centenarians can be grouped into 19 clusters characterized by different combinations of SNP genotypes—or genetic signatures—of varying predictive value. The different signatures, which attest to the genetic complexity of EL, correlated with differences in the prevalence and age of onset of age-associated diseases (e.g., dementia, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease) and may help dissect this complex phenotype into subphenotypes of healthy aging.*

**2012 Abstract** 

*Like most complex phenotypes, exceptional longevity is thought to reflect a combined influence of environmental (e.g., lifestyle choices, where we live) and genetic factors. To explore the genetic contribution, we undertook a genome-wide association study of exceptional longevity in 801 centenarians (median age at death 104 years) and 914 genetically matched healthy controls. Using these data, we built a genetic model that includes 281 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and discriminated between cases and controls of the discovery set with 89% sensitivity and specificity, and with 58% specificity and 60% sensitivity in an independent cohort of 341 controls and 253 genetically matched nonagenarians and centenarians (median age 100 years). Consistent with the hypothesis that the genetic contribution is largest with the oldest ages, the sensitivity of the model increased in the independent cohort with older and older ages (71% to classify subjects with an age at death>102 and 85% to classify subjects with an age at death>105). For further validation, we applied the model to an additional, unmatched 60 centenarians (median age 107 years) resulting in 78% sensitivity, and 2863 unmatched controls with 61% specificity. The 281 SNPs include the SNP rs2075650 in TOMM40/APOE that reached irrefutable genome wide significance (posterior probability of association = 1) and replicated in the independent cohort. Removal of this SNP from the model reduced the accuracy by only 1%. Further in-silico analysis suggests that 90% of centenarians can be grouped into clusters characterized by different “genetic signatures” of varying predictive values for exceptional longevity. The correlation between 3 signatures and 3 different life spans was replicated in the combined replication sets. The different signatures may help dissect this complex phenotype into sub-phenotypes of exceptional longevity.*
