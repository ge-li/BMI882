##### Title: FINE STRUCTURE OF A GENETIC REGION IN BACTERIOPHAGE

##### Author: SEYMOUR BENZER

In this paper, Benzer designed the recombination test to show the linear structure of DNA, that "mutations arising anywhere within the region affect the same phenotype". Further, he used the recombination rate to determine the distance of those mutations, thus "fine-mapping" the rII region. He also used the "pseudo-allelis" test to show that the rII region can be divided into functionally distinguishable segments. 

I read some peripheral materials and historical notes of this paper. I was impressed. I think this work is indeed fundamental and pioneering. It's really genius to use macro experiments to verify hypotheses on such a micro scale.  

Questions:

* Many hypotheses are generated through the development of computational biology, how can we better automate and standardize the experiments needed to verify them?
* How can we design experiments for more complex systems? For example, complex diseases and complex organs.
