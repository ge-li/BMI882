##### Title: Containing Pandemic Influenza at the Source

##### Author(s): Longini et al.

In this paper, the authors assessed the effectiveness of using different interventions (targeted antiviral prophylaxis, quarantine, and pre-vaccination) or combinations in containing an influenza pandemic using a stochastic simulation model. The model is based on a typical rural SE Asian population with 500,000 people distributed across a space of 5625 km^2. Different basic reproductive number (R_0) was studied. The results show that if the R_0 is below 1.6, targeted antiviral prophylaxis (TAP) would be sufficient. Combinations of TAP and pre-vaccination could be effective for containing strains with an R_0 as high as 2.1. A triple intervention with quarantine could contain strains with an R_0 as high as 2.4.

I read this paper with a special focus on the effectiveness of quarantine since no proved antiviral drug or vaccine exists for COVID-19 as of today (2020-03-31). One prominent feature of quarantine is that it seems quite linear to R_0 in Fig. 3 (A) (B) (D). And 70% quarantine alone cannot contain the pandemic unless the R_0 is smaller than 1.4, which is not the case for COVID-19 (estimated to be 2.28, 95%-CI: 2.06-2.52). The letter's author asks for worst-case scenario simulation. Apart from more extreme values of parameters in simulation, health care system capacity should be taken into account, because what's happening in Italy and Spain is teaching us a heavy lesson. 

Questions:

* I wonder how the effect of quarantine will alter if we change the percentages because the evidence in some Asian countries (China, Korea) did show promising results in stringent quarantine policies. 
*  Basic reproductive number (R_0) doesn't seem like a function of solely the virus itself. How do other factors affect R_0?
