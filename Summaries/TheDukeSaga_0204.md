##### Title: Deriving chemosensitivity from cell lines: Forensic bioinformatics and reproducible research in high-throughput biology

##### Author: Keith A. Baggerly & Kevin R. Coombes

In this paper, the authors examined and re-analyzed a series of papers published by Potti et al. purporting to use microarray-based signatures of drug sensitivity derived from cell lines to predict patient response. Through 5 case studies, they pointed out mistakes including but not limited to: reversed or incorrect labels, duplicated samples, the omission of "outliers", etc. All of the studies showed a serious degree of poor documentation, and lack of reproducibility, which also made it time-consuming and difficult to reveal those mistakes. The authors then recommended using better documentation, and tools to increase the reproducibility of future researches and consequently making fewer mistakes. 

I think this is absurd. As soon as the Coombes et al. (2007) paper came out, Potti et al. should have realized their mistakes and should apologize immediately. They apparently continued on the wrong path intentionally and recklessly while risking other people's life by putting them on clinical trials. This is not about doing good or bad science but about honor and integrity. I also pay my highest respect to the authors spending 1500 person-hours to fight against such bad behavior exhaustively. And I think the power of open science has been shown to not only prevent circumstances like this to happen again but also promote better collaboration and faster advancement in fields adapting such concept quickly. 

Questions:

* How do we balance the competing force of privacy concerns versus supplying raw data?
* What's your opinion on refusing to share code because of intellectual property concerns?
